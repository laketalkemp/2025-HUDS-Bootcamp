        "# What is Data Science?\n",
        "Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that involves using scientific methods processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.  The goal is to produce predictive algorithms and models to determine specific outcomes.  It is the combination of Computer Science, Math, Statistics, and Domain Knowledge to yield software development, research, and machine learning.\n",

        "# Why Data Science?\n",
        "Data Science is widely used in various industry domains, including marketing, healthcare, finance, banking, policy work, and more.  Data Science is important because it combines tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data.  This includes Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, Fraud Detection, Self-Driving Cars, Product Recommendation, Traffic Prediction.  \n",
